            So in this section you will learn how to code your first program. <br>
            I know you are excited, so I will stop talking too much and let's go to work! <br>

                        It's the main function (we will talk about functions later on in our adventure), this fucntion is, as the name says, the main one, where every thing goes. <br>
                        When you execute the program, the compiler searches for this particular fucntion to start working and executing commends.

                    As you can see we use the following line: <span>std::cout << "hey you!";</span>. The lather prints the message 'hey you!' to the console. <br>
                    First, <span>std::</span>, this helps us use the standard library funciton like cout. Second of all, <span>cout</span>, this one is pronounced "see out", it like the C language is getting something out, that's why it's use to print out stuff to the console.

                <h3>Ahmed says Hello</h3>
                <p>
                    Ahmed is new to coding, he meets you in the same class
                    that teaches C++, he has no friends so he wants to know you better. <br>
                    You saw him entring the class and you wanted to say hi, but we are geeks aren't we?
                    You decided to say "Hello World!" instead of the normal human talk.
                    <br> <br>
                    Write a program that displays the message "Hello World!" to the console. <br>
                    (try to output more messages to be happy with your first program :P)
